# Movie-Recommendation-System-Boltzmann-Machine-
Boltzmann Machine is considered one of the most complex unsupervised deep learning method which is used for recommendation systems. The following project implements a movie recommendation system which is robust and accurate , thanks to Boltzmann machines model. The model is trained on 1,00,000 movies data-set and predicts the ratings with minimal loss.
