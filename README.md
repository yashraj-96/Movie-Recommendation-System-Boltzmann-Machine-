# Movie-Recommendation-System-Boltzmann-Machine-
Boltzmann Machine is considered one of the most complex unsupervised deep learning method which is used for recommendation systems. The following project implements a movie recommendation system which is robust and accurate , thanks to Boltzmann machines model. The model is trained on 1,00,000 movies data-set and predicts the ratings with minimal loss.

# Dataset

The dataset comprises of 1,00,000 movies which correspond to those three .dat files (movies.dat , ratings.dat, users,dat) 

The train and test data correspond to the base and text files with the name 'U1'.


Boltzmann Machines requires a architecture that is implemented with a function. The functions is specifed in the code which can be used for implementing predictioni in binary format for any set of movies as input.
