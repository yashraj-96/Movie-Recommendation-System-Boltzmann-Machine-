# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Boltzmann-Machine-
Boltzmann Machine is considered one of the most complex unsupervised deep learning method which is used for recommendation systems. The following project implements a movie recommendation system which is robust and accurate , thanks to Boltzmann machines model. The model is trained on 1,00,000 movies data-set and predicts the ratings with minimal loss.

# Dataset

The dataset comprises of 1,00,000 movies which correspond to those three .dat files (movies.dat , ratings.dat, users,dat) 

The train and test data correspond to the base and text files with the name 'U1'. The U1.base file is used for train dataset and U1.test is used for test dataset.


Boltzmann Machines requires a architecture that is implemented with a function. The function is specifed in the code which can be used for implementing predictions in binary format for any set of movies as input in future.

'0' if the user didn't like the movie.
'1' if the user liked the movie.

It is complex to understand but powerful at the same time. A PDF file is attached which gives the actual equation format for implementing the archietecture step-wise and ubnderstanding the mathemeatics behind it.
